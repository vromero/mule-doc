= Build a Hello World Application
:imagesdir: images

It's time to roll up your sleeves and build your first Anypoint™ Studio
application!

As the objective of this quick tutorial is get something built and
running fast, this document doesn't spend much time explaining
components. More detailed explanations and concepts exist in the
link:Build+a+Hello+World+Application/First+Day+with+Mule.asciidoc[First Day with
Mule] and link:Build+a+Hello+World+Application/First+Week+with+Mule.asciidoc[First
Week with Mule] sections of the
link:Build+a+Hello+World+Application/Mule+Fundamentals.asciidoc[Mule
Fundamentals], but for now, let's just see Mule work: you're about to
build a very simple application in Studio, deploy it to Studio's
embedded server, then interact with the application through a Web
browser.

== Assumptions

This tutorial assumes that you
have link:Build+a+Hello+World+Application/Download+and+Launch+Anypoint+Studio.asciidoc[downloaded,
installed, and launched Anypoint Studio],  and that you've read through
the
link:Build+a+Hello+World+Application/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials.asciidoc[Anypoint
Studio Essentials].

== Creating a New Project

1.  In Anypoint Studio, click *File* then select *New* > *Mule Project*.
2.  Studio opens the *New Mule Project* wizard. In the *Name* field,
enter the value `My First Project`, then click *Finish*. +
 +

 +
3.  Studio opens a blank canvas. Begin designing your project by
dragging and dropping an *HTTP Connector* from the *palette* onto the
*canvas*. Notice that Studio automatically wraps the connector with a
*flow*, thus saving you the step of manually creating one.  +
 +

 +
4.  Add to your flow with an *Echo Component*, dragging it next to the
HTTP connector on the canvas. 
5.  Click the *Configuration XML* tab (at the base of the canvas) to see
your application represented in XML. Studio's two-way editing
functionality ensures that anything you add or change in the graphical
interface is reflected in the XML config. (Use the tabs below to see
both the graphical and XML representations of the application.)

6.  Click the *Message Flow* tab to return to the graphical editor, then
click the *save* icon to save your project. 

= Configuring the Project

Now that you've modeled a basic application in Studio, you can take the
steps to configure each individual element. 

1.  Click the HTTP Connector on the canvas to open its *Properties
Editor* in the console (see image below).
2.  The HTTP Connector allows your Mule application to connect to Web
resources through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. In a more complex
application, you would use this editor to configure values for the
attributes so as to define the connection details for your application.
For this project, keep the default values for all fields. +

 +
3.  Click the *Echo Component* on the canvas to open its *Properties
Editor* in the console (see image below).
4.  The Echo Component simply returns the message payload in response to
the HTTP request. For this project, keep the default values for all
fields. +
 +

 +
5.  Once again, you can click the *Configuration XML* to view your
changes in the XML config (see code below). Click the *save* icon to
save your changes.

== Deploying the Project

Anypoint Studio comes bundled with its own embedded server, ideal for
testing deployments as you code. You can deploy your application on the
embedded server to see it working and perform any debugging activities
before deploying to a production environment, such as an on-premises
server or link:Build+a+Hello+World+Application/CloudHub.asciidoc[CloudHub].

1.  In the *Package Explorer*, right click the project name, then select
*Run As* > *Mule Application*. +
 +

2.  Studio launches the application on the embedded server, displaying
its actions in the console. When complete, the console message reads
`Started app 'my_first_project' ` +
 +
image::firstconsole.png[image]


== Interacting with the Project

1.  Open a Web browser. 
2.  Navigate to your application's URL, appending it with a string that
becomes the message payload. For example: +
 +
`http://localhost:8081/Hello_world` +
 +
3.  The application accepts the request via its HTTP endpoint, then
"echoes" the same payload as the response in your browser. +
 +

 +
4.  In Studio, stop the application from running using the *terminate*
icon in the console (see below). +
