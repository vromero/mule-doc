= Anypoint Studio Essentials 
:imagesdir: images

An Eclipse-based, integration development environment Anypoint™ Studio
offers two development environments you can use to create applications:

1.  a Visual Editor
2.  an XML Editor

Whatever you develop or configure in one editor is reflected in the
other. This real-time reflection of changes is referred to as *two-way
editing*. Same app, different editor.

== The Visual Editor

Studio's visual editor is divided into five parts:

1.  Package Explorer
2.  Canvas
3.  Palette
4.  Connection Explorer
5.  Console

image::StudioAreas.png[image]

The *Package Explorer* displays project folders and files in a tree
format. Click to expand or contract Mule project folders and examine the
files that make up a Mule project.

The *Canvas* provides a space for arranging pre-packaged building blocks
into Mule applications. The *Palette*, on the right edge of the canvas,
displays a list of building blocks that you can drag and drop onto the
canvas to build your application. At the base of the canvas, Studio
offers three tabs which offer different ways to interface with your
application:

image::3tabs-2.png[image]

* *Message Flow*: the drag-and-drop interface in which you arrange
building blocks to form an application
* *Global Elements*: the interface for creating or editing reusable
configurations for Mule building blocks
* *Configuration XML*: the XML editor interface displays the XML
elements that correspond to the building blocks arranged on the Message
flow canvas

The *Connection Explorer* displays a list of any global connector
configurations defined in your application for quick access to your
configuration details. Behind this tab, a second tab contains an
*outline*, which displays a miniaturized overview of the whole canvas,
along with a box cursor that scrolls with the display in the canvas
pane. This provides a high-level, bird's-eye view of your complete Mule
application as it extends beyond the borders of the canvas.

The *Console* area below the canvas contains the console for the
embedded Mule server, which displays a list of events and problems (if
any) that Studio reports as you create or run your Mule application. In
the console area, you also have a *properties editor*. The propertied
editor tab is labeled with the name of the building block that is
currently selected on your canvas, or with "Mule Properties View" when
no building block is selected. The properties editor includes the
*DataSense Explorer*, which supplies real-time information about the
data structure of your payload and any available inbound and outbound
properties or variables. See an example of the properties editor
below.


== The XML Editor 

Because Anypoint Studio leverages Eclipse, the Configuration XML editor
incorporates many Eclipse features. The following is a list of handy
tips and tricks for using Studio's XML editor.

.Show Attribute Options

1.  Double click to select an attribute of an element, such as
the `host` attribute of the `HTTP endpoint` element.
2.  Press *Ctrl*+*space bar* to open a list of suggested attributes you
can configure for the element (see below).
3.  Use the up and down scroll arrows to browse through the suggestions.
4.  When you have highlighted the attribute you wish to use, press enter
to insert it into the XML configuration.  +

.Suggest Elements

1.  Enter an element's left angle bracket ( < ), then
press *Ctrl*+*space bar*.
2.  Recognizing that you are entering a new element, Studio lists all
possible element for that particular situation.
3.  Use the up and down scroll arrows to browse through the suggestions.
4.  When you have highlighted the element you wish to use, press enter
to insert it into the XML configuration.

== Building Applications in Studio

Use Anypoint Studio to arrange _*building blocks*_ on the canvas to
create _*flows*_ which, together, form an _*application*_ to process
_*messages*_.

Confused? Let's break it down.

.Building Blocks

A building block is a pre-packaged unit of business logic that comes
bundled with Mule. As the name implies, it is a block (a block of code,
really) that you can arrange with other blocks to form a structure. In
this case, you are arranging building blocks to form a Mule flow.

Building blocks fall into one of two categories depending on their
function within a Mule flow:

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Type |Function       |   Examples   
|*Message Sources*    |Message sources accept messages into flows from other sources or services. A message source always falls at the beginning of a flow and is almost always Anypoint™ Connector. | HTTP Connector, Ajax Connector, Salesforce Connector 
|*Message Processors* |Message processors filter, alter, route, or validate messages. | Payload Filter, Choice Router, Email to String Transformer
|=======================

To arrange building blocks to form a flow, simply drag and drop them
from the palette onto the canvas.

After you have arranged building blocks into a flow, you must configure
each building block individually. Click the building block to open its
*Properties* *Editor* in the console, then supply the values for the
configuration fields (see image below).

Note that the *DataSense Explorer* at the right side of the properties
editor provides helpful information about the data structure and
metadata of your message as it enters and exits this particular building
block. You can toggle the DataSense Explorer on and off by clicking this
icon:

Anypoint Studio also supports auto-complete in any message processor
configuration fields that support expressions. To open auto-complete,
place your cursor in the field and press *CTRL + spacebar*.
