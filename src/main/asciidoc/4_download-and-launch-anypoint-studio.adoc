.Running Studio on a Mac?
[NOTE]
===============================
If you're using Mac OS X Mountain Lion, there are two extra
considerations to be mindful of when running Anypoint Studio.

.Java Runtime Environment

Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 6 or 7 is in place on
your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: ` java -version`

The response should appear similar to the following:
[source] 
----
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_43-b01-447-11M4203)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.14-b01-447, mixed mode)
----
If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a
prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the
instructions to download and install JDK 6 or 7.

.Application Execution

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired
outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio
_outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running
Anypoint Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to
change your security settings to proceed. If you have Administrator
privileges, you can adjust the security settings under *System
Preferences > Security & Privacy*. However, you can also right-click on
the application to bypass the security warning and proceed to open the
app.
