The following sections aim to help you get up to speed on some key
Anypoint Platform™ concepts you'll need to be familiar with to be
successful. If you feel that you need more background on any of these
concepts, follow the provided links to the appropriate reference
material.

== Flows and Messages

Mule applications accept and process messages through a series of *message
processors* plugged together in a *flow*. A typical flow has a *message
source*, which accepts a message from an external source triggering the
execution of the flow, and any number of *message processors*, which
transform, filter, enrich, and otherwise process the message. A single
flow can be a complete application by itself, or you can connect
multiple flows together to create more complex applications.   

Mule applications also make use of *global elements*, which are reusable
chunks of code that sit outside of flows and can be invoked by multiple
elements in any flow within the application.

A Mule message consists of a *header* and a *payload*. The payload
contains the message data, and the header contains metadata about the
message in the form of *properties* and *variables*. Both properties and
variables are key-value pairs that contain useful information about a
message that help to get it where it's going.

== Message Processors

Use *Message Processors* to act upon a message to manipulate or enrich the
message payload, or to add or remove message properties or variables.
Divided into groups according to their function, each message processor
falls into one of several categories:

* *Connectors *plug into external data sources via standard protocols or
third-party APIs
* *Filters* limit processing of messages based on set criteria.
* *Components* execute specific logic upon a message, including
custom-logic programmed in Java, Javascript, Groovy, Python or Ruby.
* *Routers* direct messages through different pathways in an application
depending upon content or other set criteria.
* *Scopes* wrap snippets of code to define fine-grained behavior within
a flow.
* *Transformers* convert data types and formats so as to "translate"
messages between applications or systems.
* *Exception Strategies* handle any errors that occur during message
processing.
* *Business Events* capture data related to key performance indicators

== Batch Processing

Anypoint Studio also supports *batch jobs* as an alternative to standard flows. A
batch job is a block of code that splits messages into individual
records, performs actions upon each record, then reports on the results
and potentially pushes the processed output to other systems or queues.
This functionality is particularly useful when working with streaming
input or when engineering "near real-time" data integration between SaaS
applications.

== Mule Expression Language

Mule Expression Language (MEL)* is the primary language used for formulating
expressions in Mule, allowing you to access, manipulate, and use
information from the message and its environment. 

At runtime, Mule evaluates expressions while executing a flow to:

* extract information that it can use to process the current message
* set or manipulate a value in the message header or payload
* perform an operation on information in the message, application, Mule instance, or server

== Running Applications

Once you have created a Mule application, then what? How and where do you
make the code come to life so you can see it in action? The quickest,
easiest way is to deploy your application on the embedded *Mule Server*,
included with Anypoint Studio. There's a shiny *play* button on the top
menu bar, just like in Eclipse. Click it and Studio deploys your
application to a virtual server running on your machine.

This is great for testing, but probably not ideal for the final
implementation of your service; there are several other deployment
options to chose from:

* export the application to a *Mule Enterprise Server*
* deploy the application in the *Mule Management Console's* Application
Repository
* deploy to *CloudHub*
* deploy to an *API Gateway*
